  * Helpped with design the randomized controlled trial. 
  * Participants included 42 breast cancer survivors in the physical activity intervention arm of a 12-week randomized controlled trial, 
  and 38 breast cancer survivors in the non-intervention arm. All participants in the intervention and non-intervention group were followed up by 2-year period.
  * Used Generalized Additive Mixed Model(GAMM) to examine the pattern of adherence to wearing the Fi-bit. 
  * Use GAMM to examine the pattern of Fit-bit measured of MVPA (Moderate to Very active activity) over the 2-year follow up for both ‘Exercise’ and ‘Wellness’ group.

  * Use backward model selection methods to select the 13-metabolites variables while controlling all clinical variables in the model.
  * Use Hosmer Lemmeshow test to see how well the model actually fit the data.

  * Use time-varying cox model to address time-dependent bias and selection bias.
  * Use marginal structure models to control for time-dependent confounding.
