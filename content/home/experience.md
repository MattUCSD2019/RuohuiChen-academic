  * Developed a composite endpoint capturing clinically relevant deterioration (diary events) that, when combined with severe exacerbations, create a composite outcome (Compex). Compex can strongly mirror results seen with the severe exacerbation-validated outcome, to allow the design of clinical trials of shorter duration and that include fewer patients than trials assessing severe exacerbations. 
  * Applied the algorithm of Compex in an asthma study, Compex reduced the sample size needed by at least 50%. Validation of independent test populations confirmed the ability of Compex to increase event frequencies, preserve treatment effect, and reduce the number of patients needed.
  * Explored possible seasonal asthma exacerbation related symptoms (Breathing difficulty, Cough, Chest tightness, etc) trend during the asthma study period.
  * Provided support to other clinical trials study such as simulations for sample size calculation and power calculation.
